          <p>
            First and most importantly my family and I just made Aliyah in October of 2021! 
            I had been playing and teaching music in Brooklyn for the past 24 years. It has 
            been a real joy and pleasure to be able to make people's simchas an evening of dancing 
            and lovely melodies, or to see a child grow in his musical knowledge and gain confidence 
            both in his music playing skills and life itself. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With Hashem's help, I have taught hundreds of students to play various instruments and 
            it is one of the most rewarding things in my life. While I now live in Eretz Yisroel 
            and won't be performing in the US, I am still available to teach music over Zoom, 
            not only in the United States, but worldwide. In Eretz Yisroel I am available for in-person 
            lessons in Ramat Beit Shemesh and Yerushalayim.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my greatest joys in life is playing music. I play the piano, keyboard, acoustic guitar, and 
            ukulele. I have played at weddings, bar mitzvahs, vorts (engagement parties), sheva berachos, hachnosas 
            Safer Torahs and other events as well. I am well known for making people's simchas lively, while playing 
            at a comfortable decibel. My motto is, "Your guests will enjoy singing and dancing, but won't leave hard 
            of hearing!" Another unique feature I offer is a kumzits at your simcha. I bring my guitar and sit down 
            with the boys at the end of a Bar Mitzvah or the Chosson's friends after a Wedding and lead them in 
            hartzig (soulful) melodies. It's a great way to end your simcha on a high note. I have also led kumzits 
            events and can be booked just for guitar and vocals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I produced my album, Hodu L'Hashem in 2004. It is now available for free download on the <a href="./album.html">Mendy's Album 
              page</a>. The songs are all my own compositions. Yisroel Lamm did the arrangements and they came out phenominal! 
            I had a lot of fun making the album and I hope you enjoy it, as well. You can also download for free my newest 
            single release Hiney Anochi. It is on the <a href="./new-single.html">New Single page</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a small home studio where I have recorded various small productions from demo CDs to camp recordings. 
            One boy recorded some of his original compositions and gave out the CDs at his Bar Mitzvah.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently live in Ramat Beit Shemesh, Israel with my wife and four children.
